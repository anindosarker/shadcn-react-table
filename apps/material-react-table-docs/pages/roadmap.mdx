## MRT Roadmap

Here is what is being planned for the future of Material React Table.

### Version 3 Roadmap (2024)

Only small feature releases and bug fixes are planned for Material React Table V3. Work on MRT V4 will be the priority. Version 3's main purpose is to be an easy upgrade target for those who are looking to upgrade their Material UI packages to V6.

### Beyond Version 3 (2025 and Beyond)

The future versions of Material React Table will include much bigger upgrades and changes. These changes may come in MRT V4 or later.

- Remove all Emotion dependencies and replace them with Pigment CSS. (Better performance and slightly smaller bundle size)
- Upgrade to Material UI V7 when it comes out.
- Upgrade to TanStack Table V9 and rewrite MRT to have more modular options. (Big changes for massive decrease in bundle size, but old way of using MRT will still be supported)
- Add Joy and Base UI adapters.

#### Mantine React Table

Material React Table's sister library,[ Mantine React Table](https://mantine-react-table.com), continues to be developed in parallel, as it is nearing a stable V3 release itself. If you like MRT, but prefer to write pure CSS/CSS Modules instead of styled components or the `sx` prop, you'll probably like Mantine React Table more than Material React Table.
