## Detail Panel Example

Material React Table has multiple types of "expanding" row features. In its simplest form, you can use the `renderDetailPanel` option to render a component when a row is clicked. This is useful for showing additional information about a row, such as a list of nested data. Learn more in the [Detail Panel Feature Guide](/docs/guides/detail-panel).
